  <!-- Self-Study Questions: 
    
1. Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.

    MDN definitions: forEach() — executes a provided function once for each array element.
    map() — creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

    Explain: the forEach method doesn't actually return anything. It just calls a provided function on each element in the array. 
    This callback is allowed to mutate the calling array. THe map method will also call a provided function on every element in the array, however,
    it uses return values and actually returns a whole new Array of the same size. 

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

    A function exists in global scope on its own and a method exists within an object and that objects scope.

3. What is closure?

    Closure is the ability for a function to access variables in scopes above it.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

    Window - 'this' refers to the window object (global scope). 
    Implicit - refers to the object left of the dot. 
    Explicit - using call, apply, or bind we can "explicitly" tell the function which object's context to use. 
    New - using the new keyword this refers to the object being constructed when new is used.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?


    The super method copies the parent classes' properties into the child class without having to explicitly 
    bind the child classes' this to the parent class when using .call.
